## Intro

Users can interact with the Airbyte platform outside of the UI using an API.

This enables developers to integrate Airbyte into their monitoring system, data pipeline, or product.

Say something about testing directly in the API page.

Developers can also integrate the API using a Python or Java Airbyte SDK to make it easier:

- <a href="https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-api-java-sdk" target="_blank">Airbyte API Java SDK</a>

In this course weâ€™re going to show you how to get credentials to run commands to the Airbyte API and execute commands using Postman and Python.
