## Next Steps

Over the past modules you progressed from a quick notebook prototype to a durable data pipeline that lands records in MotherDuck and a vector store. Along the way you learned how to keep credentials secure, plug in bespoke connectors, and prepare your data for analytical and AI‑driven workloads.

### What to try next

- **Automate**   Schedule the script with GitHub Actions, Airflow, or Dagster and add basic alerting so failures don’t go unnoticed.
- **Transform**   Write SQL in DuckDB or MotherDuck to cleanse, join, and aggregate the raw streams before downstream use.
- **Enrich with AI**   Build a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation chatbot that sources answers from your Chroma collection.
- **Monitor & observe**   Add logging and lightweight metrics (rows read, runtime, state lag) so you can spot anomalies early.
- **Contribute**   Publish a new connector manifest or a case study to the Airbyte community and help others learn.
