Duration: 0:03:00

Congratulations! You've achieved a lot in a short amount of time. You've created a fully functioning data movement pipeline. You've taken data from source such as Stripe and moved it into an AI capable data storage product like Postgres and PGVector. By using Airbyte Cloud, you can quickly schedule when to move data, handle incremental changes in that data, and easily add new data sources ensuring that any AI app you build atop this data pipeline has the most up-to-date and relevant information. Remember, at the heart of AI is access to the right data.
