## You don't need to say Lesson X here

This is your first lesson. 
We're going to use the claat structure to build courses.

The file format structure must follow the rules:
1. `# Use only for the course title it won't be used to parse content`
2. `## Use to separate lessons`
3. `### If you want a head/title inside a lesson`

Questions? No, okey, let's move on.
