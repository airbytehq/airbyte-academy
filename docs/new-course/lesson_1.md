## Lesson 1

We're going to use Hackmd to write the content.
Why?
* It's easy and we can work collaborative to build the content;
* Have powerful integration with Github (what we need)
* No other reason...

This Hackmd is a meta markdown course explaining what is needed from our team to format the final format to move the course to Thinkific. So, pay attention :warning: !
