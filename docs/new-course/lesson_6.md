## Publishing a Course

The main idea is to create a new hackmd and link to the https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-academy repository. 
So every new change you can push directly to Github, you don't need to copy or move anything from Hackmd at all.
Very simple workflow.

I'll record a video explaining step-by-step, but here is main idea.

You're going to edit your course content.. (btw we can use gifs or jifs)

After you finished editing, go to top right corner:

Then click in Push, this will move your content to Github direclty.

The Github repository have a Github Action will read the edited file and break into individuals markdowns to be places in Thinkific.

The main index of our static website is: https://airbytehq.github.io/airbyte-academy/
