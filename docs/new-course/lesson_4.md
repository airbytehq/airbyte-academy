## Notes and Warnings!!! :lemon: 

We can use notes BUT, please pay attention to this.
Github sometimes do things we don't like, one of them is how they implemented notes/warnings/callouts whatosever in their markdown viewer. 

Instead of using common language of 

::: info
This is a cool info
:::

They use:
> [!Note]
> This is how Github want you to right a note in Markdown.

Anyway, we can use it, but need to follow Github convention here. Use the first won't render.
