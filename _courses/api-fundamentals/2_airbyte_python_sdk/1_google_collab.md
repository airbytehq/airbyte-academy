After copy the snippet to read the secrets in the notebook.
Now let's install the Python library to execute the commands.

from google.colab import userdata
client_id = userdata.get('AIRBYTE_CLIENT_ID')
client_secret = userdata.get('AIRBYTE_CLIENT_SECRET')
```

After running the pip install let's create a credential object is going to help us refresh the token when it got expired.
