# Introduction 

Airbyte platform allows users to interact with it using an API this way users don't need to the UI.

This enables developers integrate Airbyte into their monitoring system, data pipeline or product.

The easiest way to interact with an API is using apps like Postman or running curl command directly in the terminal.

For developers integrating the API with code. Airbyte providers a Python and Java SDK to make it easier:

* Airbyte API Python SDK
* Airbyte API Java SDK

In this course we're going to show how to get credentials to run commands to the Airbyte API to execute commands for us using Postman and Python.
